Implementing K Nearest Neighbors machine learning  technique to predict species of new iris

I used an iris data set and perform the K Nearest Neighbors machine learning 
technique to predict species of new iris. I performed exploratory data analysis to get a better understanding of data, and then I examined KNN machine learning models to predict the species of new iris. I discovered 
that petal length and width highly correlated hence they were the most important variables for our prediction. The optimal k for prediction was 3 with a total accuracy of 0.95555555556 which 
shows our model is good. As a result, we can use K=3 neighbors of the new iris to determine its specious.
